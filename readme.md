#backbone TodoList and canvas

I have finish two demo.
    1.todo-list demo I choose Backbone to build this.
    2.canvas demo

#how to run ?

1.run todo list project . find index.html in dist directory open it .
    if you want to build from src directory, make sure you have install gulp and requirejs
    then you can build like : gulp and r.js -o build.js

2.canvas demo is much easier , just find test.html and open it !
